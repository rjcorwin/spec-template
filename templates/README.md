## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Start with the TODO
Review `TODO.md` to understand the project phases and what needs to be done.

### 2. Write Your PRD
Begin with `PRD.md` to define what you're building. This is your foundation document.

### 3. Conduct Research
Use `INVESTIGATION.md` to document your research, analysis, and findings.

### 4. Design Your System
Work through `DESIGN.md` to create your system architecture and technical specifications.

### 5. Document Decisions
Create ADRs in the `adr/` directory for key architectural decisions.
