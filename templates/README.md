### 3. Conduct Research
Use `INVESTIGATION.md` to document your research, analysis, and findings.

### 4. Design Your System
Work through `DESIGN.md` to create your system architecture and technical specifications.

### 5. Document Decisions
Create decisions in the `decisions/` directory for key architectural choices.
