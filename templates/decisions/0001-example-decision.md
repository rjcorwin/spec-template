- Team has limited Vue.js experience

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Risk Level**: Medium
- **Mitigation**: Training on Vue.js and Django real-time features

**Effort Estimate**: 3 weeks for setup and team training

## üéØ Decision Rationale

### Why This Option Was Chosen
The React + Node.js stack was chosen primarily because it leverages our team's existing expertise while providing all the technical capabilities we need. The combination of TypeScript, React's component model, and Node.js's event-driven architecture provides excellent support for real-time features and rapid development.

### Trade-offs Made
- **Ecosystem Complexity**: Accepted JavaScript fatigue in exchange for rapid development and extensive library support
- **Performance**: Accepted potential performance overhead in exchange for developer productivity and team expertise
- **Enterprise Features**: Accepted less enterprise-grade tooling in exchange for flexibility and modern development practices

### Alternative Options Rejected
- **Angular + .NET**: Rejected due to high learning curve, licensing costs, and team's limited .NET experience
- **Vue.js + Django**: Rejected due to limited real-time capabilities and smaller ecosystem compared to React

## üîÑ Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- Faster development velocity due to team expertise
- Excellent real-time capabilities for collaboration features
- Large ecosystem of libraries and tools
- Easy to find developers for future hiring
- Strong community support and documentation

### Negative Consequences
- Need to manage JavaScript ecosystem complexity
- Potential performance optimization challenges
- Memory usage monitoring required
- Need to establish coding standards and patterns

### Neutral Consequences
- Will need to establish new development workflows
- May require additional tooling for enterprise features
